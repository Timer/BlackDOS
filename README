BlackDOS Project 3
------------------

The program was implemented per instructions.

Testing:

1. `boot` should re-boot shell
2. `cls` should clear the screen
3. `copy file1 file2` should copy a file; use `dir` to verify
4. `del file` should delete a file; use `dir` to verify
5. `dir` already tested
6. `echo text` should echo front-trimmed text
7. `help` shows this manual
8. `run program` runs a program, try `kitty`, `fib`, or `cal`.
9. `tweet file` prompts for a tweet to store in `file`. Verify with `type file`.
10. `type file` reads the file contents and shows them on screen, try `type msg`.
11. Hitting enter with no command does nothing but a new line.
12. Unknown commands should suggest you use `help`.
